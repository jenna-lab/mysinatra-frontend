# TO-DO LIST REACT App

## Description

The focus of this project is building a Sinatra API backend that uses Active Record to access and persist data in a database, which will be used by a separate React frontend that interacts with the database via the API.

We build a todo list application with a React frontend interface and a Sinatra backend API, where a user can:

- Create a new todo
- Read a list of all todos
- Update an individual todo
- Delete a todo
  A Todo can be tagged with a Category, so that each todo belongs to a category and each category has many todos.

## SetUp/Installation requirements

- Create a new React app using npx create-react-app.

- Set up the necessary dependencies for the frontend, including fetch (for making HTTP requests), react-router-dom (for handling client-side routing), and any other dependencies required for the project.

- Create a folder structure for your frontend that will include a components folder.

- Create a component for your Todo list, which will render a list of all the todos. This component will also have a form for adding new todos, and buttons for updating and deleting todos.

- Create a service file for making HTTP requests to the Sinatra backend. This file will use axios to make requests to the API endpoints.

- Set up the Sinatra backend by creating a new project and installing the necessary dependencies.

- Create a folder structure for your backend that will include a models folder, a controllers folder, and any other folders you may need.

- Create a model for your Todo, which will define the structure of a Todo and its association with Categories.

- Create a controller for your Todo, which will handle requests to the API endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting Todos.

- Create a migration file to create a table for your Todos in the database.

- Set up the necessary routes in your Sinatra application for the API endpoints.

- Test the application by running both the frontend and backend servers and ensuring that you can create, read, update, and delete Todos.
