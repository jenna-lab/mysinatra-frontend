## Description

The focus of this project is building a Sinatra API backend that uses Active Record to access and persist data in a database, which will be used by a separate React frontend that interacts with the database via the API.

We build a todo list application with a React frontend interface and a Sinatra backend API, where a user can:

- Create a new todo
- Read a list of all todos
- Update an individual todo
- Delete a todo
  A Todo can be tagged with a Category, so that each todo belongs to a category and each category has many todos.
